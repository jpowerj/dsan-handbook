## About the Bootcamp

The bootcamp is not structured as a traditional "class," but rather as a self-directed learning experience. It is completely asynchronous, allowing you to work at your own pace and convenience. The content provided will guide you through various exercises and challenges in R and Python, enabling you to become proficient in both programming languages.
Throughout the bootcamp, a team of Teaching Assistants (TAs) will be there to support and guide you every step of the way. We understand that learning advanced programming in R and Python can sometimes be challenging, but you don't have to do it alone. Your assigned TA will be your direct point of contact and will reach out to you via email. They are available to answer any questions you may have, provide assistance with coding, and offer guidance whenever needed. Additionally, the TAs will hold regular office hours and check in with you to ensure you're making progress and to address any concerns you may have. We encourage you to take full advantage of the expertise and support offered by our TAs as they are here to ensure your success in the bootcamp.
We want to emphasize that your learning and understanding of the materials are of utmost importance to us. In this bootcamp, we have adopted a unique approach where a team of TAs will facilitate your learning journey. Please note that this is not a traditional course with a professor, but rather a self-directed learning experience supported by our dedicated TAs.
The bootcamp follows a pass/fail grading system, and we want to assure you that while the expectation is to pass each assignment, if you encounter difficulties and do not pass initially, you will have the opportunity to revise and resubmit your work until you achieve a passing grade. Our primary focus is on your growth and mastery of the concepts, so please feel free to seek help from your TAs whenever you don't fully understand or require additional support.
Remember to submit only code that runs successfully, as we value the practical application of your skills.
The bootcamp has been carefully developed by three full-time professors: myself, Prof. James Hickman, and Prof. Nakul Padalkar. Additionally, you will have access to extra instructional videos created by our outstanding student TAs.
If you feel more comfortable with one language over the other, please adapt your focus accordingly. For example, if you excel in R but are a beginner in Python, prioritize completing the R assignments quickly and allocate more time to mastering Python. The same principle applies in reverse. It's crucial to assess your own learning needs and dedicate the necessary time to become proficient in both languages. While this bootcamp serves as a review, you are encouraged to explore additional resources and tutorials if needed.
The goal of this bootcamp is to ensure that you achieve a good or expert level in both R and Python. When the Fall term begins, it is expected that all students possess a strong command of these programming languages, as they will be utilized in DSAN 5000 and ANLY 5100.
