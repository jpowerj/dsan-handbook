# Student Mentorship Program

## Matching Mentors and Mentees

The Data Science & Analytics Student Mentorship Program was designed to provide support for incoming students, and to foster a sense of community among first-year and second-year students. Second-year student mentors act as a resource for new students and meet with their mentees throughout the academic year. Look for an email from me in early summer!
