# Logistics and Student Life

As incoming students, we recognize that you may have many important questions and concerns---we hope that the sections in this portion of the handbook can help address some of them! We are just as excited as you are and look forward to addressing all of your inquiries, for any of these questions or concerns that you don't find within the handbook.

We will be hosting several orientation events to help answer your questions. Also, if you have any questions about selecting your classes, please email me at purna.gamage@georgetown.edu or our course coordinator Prof. James at jh2343@georgetown.edu. You can also reach out to your Bootcamp TA, or email our team of current students at gradanalytics@georgetown.edu.

We are always here to help and support you!

Best wishes,
